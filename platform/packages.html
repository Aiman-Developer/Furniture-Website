  <p >Furniture refers to objects intended to support various human activities such as seating (e.g., stools, chairs, and
    sofas), eating (tables), storing items, working, and sleeping (e.g., beds and hammocks). Furniture is also used to
    hold objects at a convenient height for work (as horizontal surfaces above the ground, such as tables and desks), or
    to store things (e.g., cupboards, shelves, and drawers). Furniture can be a product of design and can be considered
    a form of decorative art. In addition to furniture's functional role, it can serve a symbolic or religious purpose.
    It can be made from a vast multitude of materials, including metal, plastic, and wood. Furniture can be made using a
    variety of woodworking joints which often reflects the local culture.</p>

  <p>Furniture, household equipment, usually made of wood, metal, plastics, marble, glass, fabrics, or related materials
    and having a variety of different purposes. Furniture ranges widely from the simple pine chest or stick-back country
    chair to the most elaborate marquetry work cabinet or gilded console table. The functional and decorative aspects of
    furniture have been emphasized more or less throughout history according to economics and fashion. Chairs are always
    for sitting in, but some are more comfortable or highly ornamented than others. Accessory furnishings are smaller
    subsidiary items such as clocks, mirrors, tapestries, fireplaces, panelling, and other items complementary to an
    interior scheme</p>
